# xtripe ship log


**🟢 [See the LIVE site here!](https://xtripe.github.io)**

Hello fellow ex-stripes. This is a place for us to share things we've shipped (projects, companies, anything really) and wish to share publicly and within the xtripe community. 

> :warning: **This repo is public**: Anything contributed here can be seen publicly. This repo is intended solely for the use of xtripes. Anyone wishing to contribute must prove they're a xtripe via the private alumni slack instance.

> ℹ Please: Only **one shipped thing per person** (under `_shipped/`). Feel free to swap it out at a later date if you wish to link to something new though!

## 👩‍🔬 Would you like to contribute?

1. Create a new file under `_shipped/` with the name of `{first_initial}{surname}.md` like `_shipped/jpadolsey.md`. **[Click here to go straight to the file creation page](https://github.com/xtripe/xtripe.github.io/new/main/_shipped/)**.

5. When you have a link to your PR, please DM me on the **xtripe slack chat** (`James Padolsey`) with a link to the PR. I can then confirm who you are and merge the PR, putting your shipped thing live! ☺️

## Done!

Note that shipped items will display in a shuffled order, not by date or name or anything like that. This is so everyone gets a chance to be above the fold. 🥳
